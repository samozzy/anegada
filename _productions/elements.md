'Elements' is a series of monologues that explore different reactions to the loss of a friend. The series grounds emotional responses in the physicality of different elements and combines poetic form with drama. 

The collection is made up of four pieces titled: 'Earth', 'Air', 'Water' and 'Fire'.

After a college party ends in tragedy, four teenagers recollect their memories of the night and the effect of the events on their own lives. Contemplating their actions and inactions, each monologue takes a snapshot of a personâ€™s unique response to grief.
