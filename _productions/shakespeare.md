'The Shakespeare Project' is a theatre collection based off of the works of William Shakespeare. Each production interprets a classic through the eyes of a traditionally supporting character and gives an alternative reading of Shakespeare's narrative.

The first in this project will be 'Mercutio's Romeo and Juliet' to be live streamed.
