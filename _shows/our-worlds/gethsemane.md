"I dreamt I was in the garden again... again."
  
In the Garden of Gethsemane Judas betrayed Jesus with his kiss. In the bed of two young lovers, this narrative of shame and betrayal plays on. This piece explores where betrayal lies as the two navigate a relationship tainted by fear and external judgement and watches on and as the garden closes in around them.
