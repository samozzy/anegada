There are two sides to every love story; ‘Mercutio’s Romeo and Juliet’ explores Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’ from the perspectives of Mercutio and Juliet, as an unlikely friendship blossoms between the pair.

In this original piece, what lies beneath the surface is just as compelling as the glossy facade of Shakespeare’s most famous doomed lovers.

Running at the Hen & Chicken's theatre as part of the Camden Fringe Festival 2021.
