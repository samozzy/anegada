"I've grown up with him, with Romeo. He's been my best friend for as long as I can remember. His eyes are the first memory I have."

There are two sides to every love story; 'Mercutio' explores Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' from the perspectives of Mercutio and Juliet, as an unlikely friendship blossoms between the pair. 

In this original piece, what lies beneath the surface is just as compelling as the glossy facade of Shakespeare's most famous doomed lovers.
