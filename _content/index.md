title: Hello!
---

Based in the East Midlands, we strive to make art that is diverse and will spark conversation. Through adaptations that reframe traditional literature and original productions that experiment with poetry, drama and visual media, we aim to create theatre that is unique and challenges our audiences.

We are dedicated to making sustainable and accessible productions that promote diversity and inclusivity. In light of Covid-19 we are focusing on livestream theatre and visual media, but hope to return to live theatre in the future.
