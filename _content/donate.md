Donations made between 5th December and 14th February will be split between The National Youth Arts Trust and the cast and team behind ‘Mercutio's Romeo and Juliet’, with 30% going to The National Youth Arts Trust.

The National Youth Arts Trust exists to do something about inequality in the performing arts industry and to ensure a career in the Arts is accessible to all. They provide bursaries and drama projects to help talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds train in dance, music and drama.
