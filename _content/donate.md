All donations made through this website are split between the cast and crew of 'Alice' on our UK Tour this summer.

‘Alice’ is a 50 minute poetical theatre piece that was first workshopped in 2021, reimagining Carroll’s classic and asking how to be a female presenting artist in a new and confusing wonderland.

This summer is the world premiere tour of this play to audiences around England.
