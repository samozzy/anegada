All donations made before 31/08/2021 are split between the cast and crew of 'Mercutio's Romeo & Juliet' as well as 30% going straight to The National Youth Arts Trust.

The National Youth Arts Trust exists to do something about inequality in the performing arts industry and to ensure a career in the Arts is accessible to all. Their bursaries and drama projects help talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds train in dance, music, and drama.
